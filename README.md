# 🌫️ Air Monitoring System – IoT Project

This project is an **Air Quality Monitoring System** using **Arduino** and various environmental sensors. It monitors real-time data like **temperature**, **humidity**, and **air quality**, and displays the results accordingly.

---

## 📌 Features

- Monitors air quality levels (e.g., CO, CO₂, PM)
- Detects temperature and humidity
- Provides visual indicators (LED or display)
- Can be integrated with IoT platforms like ThingSpeak or Blynk (optional)

---

## 🧰 Hardware Used

- Arduino UNO (or compatible)
- MQ-series gas sensors (e.g., MQ135)
- DHT11 / DHT22 sensor
- OLED / LCD display (optional)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power supply

---

## 🧠 Software Used

- Arduino IDE
- C/C++ (Arduino language)
- Serial Monitor for debugging

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Sensors continuously collect environmental data.
2. The Arduino processes sensor input and calculates real-time conditions.
3. Data is displayed or transmitted to an IoT platform if integrated.
4. Alerts or indicators can trigger if air quality crosses a threshold.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project.
2. Open `AirMonitoringSystem_IoT.ino` in Arduino IDE.
3. Connect your sensors and board as per the schematic.
4. Upload the code to your board.
5. Monitor the data using the Serial Monitor or display.
